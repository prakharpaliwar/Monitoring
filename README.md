# Monitoring
The monitoring project contains multiple namespaces, each serves their own functionality. The event namespace contains composites that's related to event logic; the correlation namespace contains composites that's related to correlation logic; the result namespace contains composites that's related to the result processing logic; the dps namespace contains composites and functions related to dps(redis) processing; the util namespace contains the global data types and functions used in the project.

The whole flow of the job consists of a ETL job reading data from Kafka, an Indices job reading indices, a RuleSource job for Event logic that manages the event rules to use, a RuleSource job for Correlation Logic that manages the correlation rules to use, an EventRuleProcessor that process the event logic, a CorrelationRuleProcessor that process the correlation logic, a ResultToEmail job that sends out the alerts via email, a ResultStorage job that stores the result into Vertica, and a ResultToCEM job sending alerts to CEM.
